  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>UnifiOS DNS Manager is a utility designed to help manage static DNS and conditional forwarder entries on devices such as the Unifi Dream Machine Pro.</p>
    <p>The utility works in a few parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This web UI</li>
      <li>A Python FastAPI API managing persistent entries in a SQLite database</li>
      <li>Entries in a dnsmasq configuration file on the device itself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By keeping entries persistent in a separate database, and regularly checking to see if the device configuration needs to be updated, we are able to persist DNS entries across events such as reboots and other changes.</p>
    <h2>Addresses</h2>
    <p>Entries in the Addresses section are for linking a single, fully qualified domain name to a specific IP address. For example you might want to link the name "unifi.example.com" to the address "10.0.0.1". The notes field is purely for your reference, and as such is optional.</p>
    <h2>Forwarders</h2>
    <p>Entries in the Forwarders section are for configuring conditional DNS forwarding. Conditional DNS forwarding is a method to direct DNS queries related to a specific domain to another DNS server. For example if you maintain a separate DNS server for the custom domain "example.com", you could forward all queries for "example.com" to this DNS server.</p>
    <p>For full details on how the utility functions, or instructions for installing or upgrading it, please see my <a href="https://github.com/loredous/unifios-dns-manager" target="_blank">Github repository</a></p>
